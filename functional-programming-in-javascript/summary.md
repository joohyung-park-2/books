### Ch.1 함수형 길들이기
- OO makes code understandable by encapsulating moving parts. FP makes code understandable by minimizing moving parts. by Michael Feathers
- 1.1. FP 유용성
  - JS는 상태관리가 개발자 책임, 동적인 플랫폼 -> 버그 양산
    - FP가 해결책
- 1.2. FP?
  - Abstration of data control flows / operations
    - reducing side effects / state mutation
  - A chain of reusable, reliable, and smaller components
  - function(code) parameterization
  - 1.2.1. Decralative programming
    - description(by expression) seperated from evaluation(by control flow / state mutation)
	- lambda expression / arrow function since ES6: a replacement of anonymous function
	- stateless, immutable, aka pure fuction
  - 1.2.2. Pure function and Side effects
    - no dependency, but inputs
	- Known side effects
	  - Mutation on global scoped states
	  - Mutation on function argumnets
	  - User input processing?
	  - Throw without catch by the function firing exception
	  - Output on stdout / files
	  - DB querying
	- 
  - 1.2.3.
